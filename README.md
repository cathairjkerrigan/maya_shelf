# Maya Shelf

Creates a custom shelf and custom menu on Maya's startup.

Can replace "repos" with your own code to include in the shelf/menu.

Includes a reload function to reload any modules inside of the repos folder to update the code with your changes without having to re-run the code or reopen maya. Note this won't affect the shelf or menu.

# Install

Copy all folders and files under SRC to your Maya scripts folder
